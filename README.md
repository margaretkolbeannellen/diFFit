X-ray diffraction data fitting software

Compilation of student work and my previous XRD coding (portions already used in xraylarch) to create a suite of data processing software for diffraction analysis.

GOALS: 
Analysis of XRD
(1) mapped data
(2) 1D powder data
(3) 2D powder data
(4) 2D "spotty" data (single grains or textured materials)

Began GitHub repository Summer 2020 with Q.G.
